Once upon a time there was a girl named Samantha who lived in a mansion
It was a lonely existence, since her parents didn't have time to take care of 
her, but at least she had a close friend in the live-in maid, Martha, who her
parents hired to take care of her.
There is a forest near the house. Sometimes Martha and Samantha goes to the 
forest together. They enjoy playing hide and seek. Both the mansion and the
forest are good places to play hide and seek.
