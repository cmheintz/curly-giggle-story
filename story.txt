Once upon a time there was a girl named Samantha who lived in a mansion
It was a lonely existence, since her parents didn't have time to take care of 
her, but at least she had a close friend in the live-in maid, Martha, who her
parents hired to take care of her.
There is a forest near the house. Sometimes Martha and Samantha goes to the 
forest together. They enjoy playing hide and seek. Both the mansion and the
forest are good places to play hide and seek.
But one day, Samantha becomes lost. All she can see are trees, trees, and 
trees. It is getting late - the normally beautiful orange rays of sun 
divided by tree branches are now an scary omen. Samantha calls out,again 
and again, and just and the darkness settles in, she hears a rustling
behind her...
